    "Airbnb is an online service that connects hosts with properties for rent to travellers interested in renting short-term homestays. The host of the home is the determinant of the price but will set it according to an array of factors, such as location, view, and cleaning service fee. \n",
    "\n",
    "***We are interested in whether factors such as the distance to the city centre and the nearest metro station influence the price of an Airbnb rental in Paris on a weekday***. This will be the question we will try to answer, and using these factors, we will see its influence in the city of our choice, Paris, for a private 2 person room on any given weekday. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Jones (2023), particularly the factors of public transportation and to the city centre play a great deal in convenience when it comes to travel. Paul Swinney, a writer at the Guardian, even stated that proximity to the city centre drives up renting costs, given the higher productivity and economic activity associated with the city (Swinney, 2011). Because of the importance of these factors, with convenience, efficacy, and overall higher enjoyment of the city at the heart of it, we decided to choose these variables to analyze the price of our rental. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to see the relationship between these variables and the Airbnb rental price, we will be analyzing the paris_weekdays.csv dataset from Airbnb Prices in European Cities posted on the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities?resource=download&select=paris_weekdays.csv) (Gyódi & Nawaro, 2021). The dataset is a .csv file with 3129 observations and twenty vector variables. We will be using four of the variables in our analysis, we'll be using two of them, the capacity of the rental property (person_capacity), and the type of room of the rental (room_type) to filter the dataset and two others, the distance to the city centre (dist) and the distance to a metro station (metro_dist) to predict the price of the rental property (realSum). All the variables are double (dbl) except room_type, which is a character (chr)."

Here we can see the points in the lower left corner have the most favourable conditions according to a general person since these points have the least distance from transportation and the city centre. However, even though these points have favourable conditions, most belong to the cheaper end of the spectrum. One thing to note is that our average price is 274 which falls in the (200,500] price bracket. Even though the points in the left corner may seem to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum, from the graph, it can be seen that most of the points are green, so they are near the average."

    "Through our analysis of predicting the price of a two-person private room in Paris on a weekday, we found that the distance from the Airbnb rental to the city centre and the distance to the nearest metro station helped predict the actual price. We expected private room rentals with a two-person capacity closer to the city centre and closer to the metro would be more expensive than those farther away. However, the optimized k-value we used in our analysis gave us a low accuracy. We expected to have a higher accuracy to be sure about the determinates predicting the price range of an Airbnb rental. \n",
    "\n",
    "This may indicate that other factors beyond distance to the city centre and distance to the metro station affect the price of an Airbnb rental. According to Zhang et al. (2017), other factors that increase the price of an Airbnb rental include: the rental having a positive Airbnb reputation via positive reviews, the rental having many reviews, and the distance from the rental to landmarks (not just city centre and metro stations). Also, host and rental attributes, rental amenities and services, and rules regarding the rental all affect the price. Not including some or all of these factors affects the accuracy of the analysis, thus causing lower accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any impacts from this study will help Airbnb hosts determine the private room price that they charge for their rental based on the criteria we used in the study. It will also help renters gauge how much to expect to pay when staying in areas similar to those in the study. This will also help Airbnb focus its advertising on criteria that matters to renters and hosts to create more business, increasing their profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the factors we did to determine the price of Airbnb rentals and the low accuracy returned may lead Airbnb, Airbnb renters or hosts, or other interested parties to ask questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there better price predictors for an Airbnb rental that were not used, such as cleanliness rating and overall guest satisfaction? Do these findings also occur in other Airbnb cities? Is there a difference in price for Airbnb rentals in urban areas compared to rural areas using the same criteria? Do the same criteria for weekday rental prices also apply to weekend rentals?"
