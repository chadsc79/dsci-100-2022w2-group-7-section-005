    "Airbnb is an online service that connects hosts with properties, to travelers that are interested in renting for short term homestays.The host of the home is the determinant of the price, but will set it according to an array of factors, such as location, view, cleaning service fee etc. For our report, we are interested in whether particular factors, such as the capacity of the rental, distance to the city center, and to the nearest metro station, influenced the price. We will use these predictors to help us predict the the price of a private room Airbnb rental in Paris on any given weekday. \n",

    "The dataset we will be using is paris_weekdays.csv from Airbnb Prices in European Cities posted on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities?resource=download&select=paris_weekdays.csv. The dataset is a .csv file with 3129 observations and 20 vector variables. We will be using 6 of the variables to make our predictions: dist, metro_dist, person_capacity, and room_type will be used to predict realSum. All the variables are double (dbl) except room_type, which is a character (chr).\n"
